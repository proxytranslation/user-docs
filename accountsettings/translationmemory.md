# Translation memory

![Translation memory settings](/img/account-settings/account-translation-memory.png)

As mentioned in the [section about translation memories on the Dashboard 2.0](/dashboard2/settings/translationmemory.html), translation memories are linked to your account and *not* your project. This way, if you want to, you can have one gigantic translation memory for all of your projects. This is useful if you have multiple projects of the same topic. This page allows you to view and manage all of the memories associated with your account.

You can create new memories as well as change the name and target languages of your existing memories. Then you can use them by assigning them to the projects that you need them on.
