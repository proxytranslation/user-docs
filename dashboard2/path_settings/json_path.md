# JSON Path

Override the JS/JSON paths that you have defined in Advanced settings under the menu JavaScript translation options (JSON / variables). With this option, you can use different paths for a given prefix, and optimize the translation of the JavaScript files.

We recommend that you use the [JSON path tester](../jptt.html#json-path-tester) tool to gather these paths.

## Parameters

- Override search paths: path-specific JSON paths
