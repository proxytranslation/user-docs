# Recurring crawls

_Recurring crawls_ instruct the crawler to periodically go through the site looking for new/changed content. They are most useful once the intial translation is complete and the project moves into the _maintenance_ phase of its life cycle. You can see your scheduled crawls in this section

You can read more about scheduled crawls and the automation possibilities they allow in conjunction with Auto pre-translate [here](../../maintenance/scheduled_scans.html).
