# Recurring crawls

_Recurring crawls_ instruct the crawler to periodically go through the site looking for new/changed content. They are most useful once the intial translation is complete and the project moves into the _maintenance_ phase of its life cycle.

You can read more about [scheduled crawls here](../../maintenance/scheduled_scans.html).
