# Delete entries

![Delete entries dialog](/img/dashboard2/delete_entries.png)

Use this section to delete segments from the proxy. You have 2 main options:

- **Delete based on source content and timeline**: Select a time period (the default is `Project created` to `Now`) and enter a [Java regular expression](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/regex/package-summary.html) to search in the source of the segments.

- **Delete all the source entries with no translation on any target language** allows you to clean the project from unwanted entries that have no translations yet.
