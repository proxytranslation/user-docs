# Previous exports

![Previous exports dialog](/img/dashboard2/previous_exports.png)

Although the notification e-mail does contain the link to your exported file, there is no reason to track it from your mailbox. This dialog will list and organize all previous exports for your viewing with the appropriate creation time, target language and word count displayed alongside Export list entries.
