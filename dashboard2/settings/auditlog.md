# Audit log

![Audit log](/img/dashboard2/audit_log_screen.png)

The audit log is the minutes-taking feature of the proxy. It records all activity on the project with a username/e-mail address attached to each entry.

You have multiple options to filter the events that are displayed. Using the dropdown menus on the top, you can view entries created after a specific date, filter for a specific user's actions or the type of the action.

You can also add memos to the entries by clicking on them. This way, you can track *why* a specific setting change was necessary.
