# Project maintenance##

The translation project of a website is a continuous task, as new content is regularly added to the site. So uploading the initial translation is not the end of the project, but the beginning of a new phase. This phase is practically a repetitive cycle of the following activities, many of which can be automated:

- checking the site for new content
- extracting new content for translation
- translation of the new content
- uploading the new translation
- and, of course, error fixing, if needed
