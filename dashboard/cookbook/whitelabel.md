# Whitelabel Setup

1. A €200 EUR topup / month (recurring): the translation proxy under your own brand
   name is special service, offered to customers who cater not only to
   one or two clients, but put their weight behind the punch and open
   up whole new markets with our proxy solution.

2. A one-time setup fee of €200.

3. A custom domain name: you will need a place to serve the translation proxy (as
   well as any previews) on. Generally, our clients settle on
   `app.${yourdomain}.com`, but we can use practically anything that
   comes to your mind - the only limitation is that we are unable to
   serve the proxy on a naked domain (for instance,
   `yourproxy.com`). Just keep in mind that once you settle on
   something, and we set up your branded Easyling, it becomes fixed,
   so your decision is final.

4. Two logos: one goes on the Dashboard, the other goes on the
   Workbench. They should be transparent PNGs, ideally, but we can use
   other file formats as well. However, their dimensions are fixed:
   the Dashboard logo is set at 200x62px, while the Workbench logo
   needs to be 109x44px.

5. An SSL certificate: the translation proxy uses encrypted channels to communicate
   on, and for that, we require an SSL certificate to be made out for
   the domain name of your choice, and any subdomains it may have -
   the translation proxy uses your "app domain" to serve previews until they're
   published, so your certificate must be a so-called "wildcard
   certificate" (a type of SSL certificate valid not only for
   `app.yourdomain.com`, but also `*.app.yourdomain.com`). Certificate
   issuers are likely to request a Certificate Signing Request (CSR)
   for the certificate, which we will have to provide.

In order to generate a CSR for you, you'll need to provide a few
pieces of data related to your company, which need to be incorporated
into the certificate. Please provide the following by replacing the
fields (this should look fairly familiar to your IT department) with
the appropriate data.

	1. `countryName_default = ${COUNTRY}`
    
	2. `localityName_default = ${CITY}`
    
	3. `streetAddress_default = ${ADDRESS}`
    
	4. `postalCode_default = ${ZIP}`
    
	5. `0.organizationName_default = ${COMPANY_NAME}`
    
	6. `organizationalUnitName_default = ${ORG_UNIT}`
    
6. The final step is to configure your DNS servers; and if you use
   Google Apps for `yourdomain.com`, the setup process will require
   someone with Google Apps admin rights as well. You will need to add
   the following CNAME records to enable the translation proxy on your domain:

	1. `${APPENGINE_KEY}.${APP_DOMAIN}` CNAME `${APPENGINE_HASH}` - these values will be provided to you.
    
	2. `${APP_DOMAIN}` CNAME `ghs.domainverify.net`
    
	3. `*.${APP_DOMAIN}` CNAME `ghs.domainverify.net`
    
7. In order for the translation proxy to be able to send emails from under your
   domain, you will need to provide authorization to the email
   service. This is done by adding specialized DNS records.

 	1. `mandrill._domainkey.${APP_DOMAIN}` TXT `v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQCrLHiExVd55zd/IQ/J/mRwSRMAocV/hMB3jXwaHH36d9NaVynQFYV8NaWi69c1veUtRzGt7yAioXqLj7Z4TeEUoOLgrKsn8YnckGs9i3B3tVFB+Ch/4mPhXWiNfNdynHWBcPcbJ8kjEQ2U8y78dHZj1YeRXXVvWob2OaKynO8/lQIDAQAB;`
    
	2. `${SELECTOR}._domainkey.${APP_DOMAIN}` TXT `${DKIM_KEY}` - these values will be provided to you as they are domain-dependent.
    
	3. `v=spf1 include:spf.mandrillapp.com include:sparkpostmail.com ?all`; or if you're already using an SPF record, add `include:spf.mandrillapp.com include:sparkpostmail.com` just before the last operator.
    
8. Finally, if you want, you can specify the following information to
   customize the white label experience (this is completely voluntary
   and can be changed at any time):

	1. name: Name of your branded product
    
	2. greeter: Person signing the greeting emails for new users
    
	3. team: Team name
    
	4. greeter address: Email address of the person sending the greeting emails
    
	5. greeter display name: Name of the person sending the greeting emails
    
	6. noreply address: Email address used for automated emails
    
	7. noreply name: Display name used for automated emails
    
	8. quote and wordcount signer: Person signing the quote and word count emails

Once all seven main points are settled, and we have the logos and the
SSL certificate with us, we'll set up the white label version for you,
and you'll be ready to start cracking your target market wide open.
