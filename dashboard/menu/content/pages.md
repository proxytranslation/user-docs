# Pages & Resources & External links

Currently, these three submenus are duplicated between the Discovery and Content menus. See the pertaining [Discovery section](../../menu/discovery/pages.md) for details.

**IMPORTANT!** There is an important difference between the Add Pages dialogs of the two page lists: If the Add Pages dialog is opened from Discovery > Pages, it will start a word count Discovery; opening it from the Content > Pages menu will result in a content extraction Scan!
