# Export translation

By clicking on this link, the general Export dialog will open. Most of the options will be familiar from the Work package generation dialog.  Choose a file format of your preference (with XLIFF being the _de facto_ industry standard, it is recommended that you go with this option, as it is more structured than CSV).

**Languages to export** You can choose to export more than one target languages in one go, or choose to export them all.

**Export range** Click on "change" and use the timeline window to specify the time period, and the export function will be limited to that timeframe. Select any two timestamped buttons to define the start and end of the time frame.

**Export** You can choose between exporting only those entries that lack a translation, or include all entries.

**Unique segments only** Check this option to ensure that identical segments are not duplicated in your exported XLIFF file.

**Skip exlcuded and pending segments from export** Export only those segments that have been approved for translation on the Workbench.

**Trim export to contain as few tags and whitespaces as possible** Use this option to clean the source segments of tags for the purposes of translation.

**Split** enter the number of segments that you'd like to have in a single file, and the export will split your segments into separate files accordingly.

**Copy source to target where empty**

**Send XLIFF files** Choose among your XTM, XRTF or Dropbox accounts to send your exported files to. Each of these accounts has a link at the bottom of the dialog that will take you to the given account's setting screen.

Click on Export to execute. Wait for the process to finish - you will receive an e-mail when your files are ready.
