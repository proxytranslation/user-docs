# MemoQ

## Overview

The proxy is capable of providing read-only access to previews within MemoQ itself, using the MemoQ plugin. This will require you to log into the system from within MemoQ, and load up a proxy-generated export.

## Using

MemoQ allows you to grant read-only access to your proxy account on a project-by-project basis. You can choose one or more projects to grant access to and you can revoke authorizations during login as well.

After logging in, loading a proxy-created XLIFF file in MemoQ will allow you to preview your translations in-context, by providing a preview of the translated page directly within the application, which updates as translations are edited.

> Nota Bene: the live-updating preview does **not** mean that translations are streamed to the proxy for inclusion, as the access granted to the MemoQ application is **ready-only**! You will still need to save the XLIFF file and import it to return the translations to the project!
