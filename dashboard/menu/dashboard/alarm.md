# Alarm

You can set up alarms to be notified of any actions in your project
that could potentially lead to undue expenses. Enter the value for the
timeout (snooze) between subsequent e-mail notifications, to prevent
the Alarm from flooding you with e-mails. After that, check one of the
alarm options and enter the limit above which you want to receive a
notification. You can set an alarm for:

**Page Views**: if you wish to detect unusually large amounts of
requests to the proxy. As Scans and Discoveries count as Page Views,
you can also use this alarm to detect if a Scan was started.

**Words added**: if you wish to receive notification about new content
that exceeds the set amount. 

**Words translated**: if you wish to receive notification about
Machine Translation or reimport events on the project.

The e-mails are sent to the owner by default, but you can add the
'Receive notification emails' right to any participant in Dashboard >
Sharing settings.
