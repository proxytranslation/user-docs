# Domain settings

This screen opens by default after clicking on "Publish website". The following settings and fields are available:

**Target language** Choose which target language you would like to configure a serving domain for.

**Temporary domain** This is the preview proxy you can use to preview your translations live (this is immutable).

**Access control** you can add basic HTTP authentication to the proxied site in order to restrict access to it. Click on _Configure access control..._. Select the proxy modes that you'd like to limit access to, enter your username and password. You can add multiple users to the list.

## Serving domain mode (de.example.com)

In the serving domain mode, the translation proxy will publish the translated site either on a subdomain of the original (the default behavior, such as `de.example.com`), or on a completely separate naked domain (such as `example.com`). In order to use this mode, you (or the client) will have to modify the DNS settings corresponding to the original domain - the three to five records (three for subdomains, five for new naked domains) that need to be inserted in your DNS settings are found below the two input fields, and will change as you enter the desired serving domain.

### CNAME settings

There are three CNAME settings that are required on your domain to enable publishing of your website. Each of the lines in the table that is displayed has a specific function:

**CNAME 1** allows mapping of the subdomain in Google AppEngine, enabling us to alter the datastream and translate the site. This row is computed from the serving domain entered in the second input field, and needs to be added once per serving domain.

**CNAME 2** The second line determines where the currently selected target language will be published. This defaults to the language code, but you are not obligated to keep it that way. This has to be entered separately for every target language you publish.

**CNAME 3** The third line verifies ownership of the original domain. This is computed from the userâ€™s ID who is currently looking at the publishing page (i.e. different users will see different values, so one person should communicate this to the client and hit the Verify button), and needs to be added only once per serving domain as well. You can set the subdomain and domain where the translated site will appear.

After all the settings have been entered into the DNS records, there is short time while the changes propagate and are replicated across the world. This can vary wildly with the DNS and hosting providers, taking anywhere between one and twenty-four hours. It is recommended to wait out the twenty-four hours, as the translation proxy will not be able to save the published domain until all checks are passed.

### HTTPS & SSL certificates

Additionally, if the original site was HTTPS, or the translated sites will be served over a secure channel, an appropriate certificate and its associated key will also be needed. Ideally a wildcard certificate (one certificate for all subdomain), but Extended Validation certificates can also be used, although they require more setup work. Our support team can also provide you with the Certificate Signing Requests necessary for the generation of these certificates - this will also have the added benefit of not having to send the private keys over the wider web for recording in AppEngine.

See the pertaining section of the documentation here.

## Subdirectory publishing (example.com/de)

The alternative to subdomain-based publishing is to publish the site to retain your own domain, and publish the site as a subdirectory of the existing domain, i.e. the translated pages will be available on separate paths under your own domain. However, due to the way the proxy operates, this will require a specifically configured nginx reverse proxy server to be prepared and placed in front of your own webserver.

An example configuration snippet is available on the publishing interface, but this should be treated as only a guideline, to be customized according to your specific setup!

There are a variety of options at your disposal when implementing subdirectory publishing on your domain. You may choose to use `nginx`, `CloudFront` or any similar solution to use as a reverse proxy.
