# External links

External links point to domains different from the project domain, including any of its subdomains. If you are working on a project for `www.example.com`, `blog.example.com` is considered *external* to it (in addition to any other domain). If you want to translate HTML content on `blog.example.com`, consider creating a separate project and work on the translations via [project linking](../../menu/dashboard/linkprojects.html). 

Any other type of content seen as an external link can be localized, which means changing it to point to a different resource for the target language (which must be provided externally in the same format as the original). The proxy will replace the given external link automatically in each language where an alternative is provided. 

The process is simple: go to Discovery > External links or Content > External links and click on "Select" in the hover menu of a link to localize it. The language selector in the left side menu will let you choose the language for which to make changes.

Embedded videos are frequent targets of such external link localization.
