# Contacting Support

Website translation can be a complex task, even with the help of a piece of software like the proxy. Finding the root of the problem can be equally complex for those of us on support duty. Therefore, we would like to give you a few pointers on what information to supply if you decide to contact us.

This first thing we need is the **project code**. This eight-character unique string uniquely identifies the project. As you can see in the screenshot below, the project code is located in the address bar of your browser - you can copy the entire URL for us, but the project code by itself should suffice.

We also need a **thorough description of the problem**.  Screenshots are tremendously helpful, especially if you have layout issues on the translated site. If you're running into translation issues, please give an example segment along with the page link it can be found on.

If you have issues with importing XLIFF or TMX files, please attach them so that we can take a look. If you have questions about statistics, reports, or crawl logs, attaching or linking them in your query will considerably speed things up for us.

The information you provide will help us uncover the root cause of the problem. This often requires a bit of "detective work" on the original site, so we ask for of your patience while we figure things out. Someone from the support team will respond shortly with a solution, a request for more information, or simply an update.
