# Introduction

Translation Proxy is a cloud-based translation proxy solution designed to make websites available in several languages. 

A translation proxy is a layer placed between the browser and the original website, through which the visitor sees the original website in a different language.

There are several proxy solutions available on the market, yet the translation proxy is unique in that:

- it is a solution targeted primarily at language service providers (LSPs) - which also means that this is the **only** LSP-independent solution on the market;

- it is also available as a white-label solution;

- a standard-compliant XLIFF export option ensures CAT-independence;

- an automated XLIFF export/import option is available between CAT / Translation management systems and the proxy;

- in-context live preview is available in certain CAT-tools and the online Workbench for translation.

**What does that mean?**

If you are a **business owner**, it can help you reach a wider customer base by providing information to your potential customers in their native language. What's more, you can do more than just translating the text on your website, you can ***localize*** it: you can also adapt your message, the images displayed, or even your product range offered to the targeted culture. All of this is possible without the need for heavy upfront investment in IT infrastructure and personnel or the hassle with regular maintenance and upgrade. The translation proxy takes care of the IT part so that you could concentrate on the content - and growing your business.

If you are a **language service provider** (LSP), you can offer cutting-edge website localization services to your customers - even under your own brand name! The translation proxy provides the technology, takes care of the IT infrastructure, leaving you to concentrate on your core business: cross-cultural communication. What's more, your translators don't need to learn to use just another tool, they can keep using their preferred CAT-tools.<br>

**Sounds good?**

There are several challenges both business owners and language service providers face during website translation. The "ideal" workflow would be to create the content in the original language, get it translated into the desired languages, and then publish all language variants at the same time, from the website owner's own content management system (CMS) - right from the very first page on the website. However, reality is often different. Apart from the fact that not many CMSs are capable of handling several languages, website localization usually comes into the picture at a later stage, when there is already a huge amount of data published on the website. In most cases, the website owner can't extract the content for translation. If they can't extract the original, there's no easy way to load the translated content back either. Furthermore, if the website owner can't extract the content into a translatable format, it is impossible to get a proper estimate for the translation costs in time and money.

The proxy can, however, discover the website by following links and grabbing translatable and localizable content - and convert it into a translatable format. This gives a realistic view of the magnitude of the translation task, and, thanks to the translation proxy, even a partially translated site can give full user experience on the website visitor's side.

Data can be extracted with a couple of clicks - and the publication of the translated site is similarly easy.

**Where do we fit in the localization workflow**

The proxy bridges the gap between the CMS and the translation workflow; it enables you to extract content from the website in a translation-ready format that can be used in ***any*** translation environment.

- If you are a content owner, it means that you have a technology solution that enables you to choose any LSP that suits your language requirements the best.

- If you are an LSP, it means that you can take care of the website translation requirements of your clients.

In either case, technology will no longer be the bottleneck.

## White-label

The proxy offers a white label version that can be customized with your corporate logos and domains to create a branded version, allowing you to use & sell the translation proxy as your own product. To create the branded version, seven criteria must be met. See the "White-label setup" section for details.

## Pricing - plans

Based on the feedbacks from our client, we've built an all-inclusive pricing model, with a predictable, flat-rate monthly fee and a few add-ons. With the only variable being the number of translatable source words, it's easy to multiply by the number of target languages to get the final TCO.

### Add-ons

- **Translation proxy**: with the new pricing scheme, JavaScript publishing is the default, while the proxy is available as an optional add-on
- **Site search**: recommended if native site search is required
- **SEO setup**: CDN / reverse proxy integration is required for subdirectory publishing, highly recommended to enhance SEO effectiveness
- **Layout adjustment**: depending on the structure of the original site and the language pair, the translation might yield to text expansion, breaking the look and feel of the site. Fixing issues could involve a need for professional attention, changing the layout of the translated pages.


## Pricing - grandfathered pay-as-you-go

Our old pricing follows the ‘pay-as-you-go’ model, so you only get charged for what you use. The total cost is made up of 2 types of fees: one-time fees and a monthly charge. It's still available for the time being upon demand.

### One-Time Fees

- **Discovery**: 1 EUR or 1.2 USD / 1000 pages for every Discovery

- **Scan**: 2 EUR or 2.4 USD / 1000 source words for each **new** word during a Scan (if no new words are found, a Scan counts as a Discovery)

- **Translation Memory**: storing your (human or machine) translation in the database costs 10 EUR or 12 USD / 1000 source words / target language

Content extraction and translation memory fees apply only the first time around, which means 102% repetitions are not counted. Once a segment is stored, subsequent scans will treat it as repetition and **no additional charges** will apply.

### Monthly Fees

A 1 EUR or 1.2 USD / 1000 page requests monthly fee is applied for serving your translated content over the proxy.

In exchange, you get a guaranteed 99.99% website availability, and a capacity to handle practically unlimited traffic. You also have the option to serve the translated site from your server (in which case no proxy fee will apply), but in this case, availability and traffic handling depend on your infrastructure.
